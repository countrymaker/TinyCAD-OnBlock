This example is "nibbles" a 4-bit processor example that shows how to use the VHDL functionality of TinyCAD.

You can get more information about VHDL export [here](https://github.com/matt123p/TinyCAD/wiki/Using-VHDL-with-TinyCAD). 

_Note:_ You need to have ghdl and gtkw installed in the same folder as nibbles to simulate the processor.
